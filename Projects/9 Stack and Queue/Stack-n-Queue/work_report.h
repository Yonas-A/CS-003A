/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: big three funciton, Empty(), Push function
                      for both stack and queue class,
                      top() for stack and Front() for queue, bracket
                      operator, pop(), search functions, insertion
                      operator and size function for both classes

             *Note    bottom() for Stack is similar to End() for Queue
                      its just since we used top() for the first node
                      opposite of top was bottom

             **Note   both end and bottom functions return nullptr
                      but when testing pop() I had them return the last
                      to check if _end_ptr would be set to null after
                      removing entire item from list


        -Partly implemented:none

    Bugs:
        -None

    Reflections:
        - This was an easy project.the hardest part was writing the
          list functions but after that stack and queue was just making
          a few changes to the List class
