/*
    Features:
        -Implemented: 
        
            Constructors and distructors, Empty, Push.
            
            top() for stack and Front() for queue, bracket operator, pop, search,
             insert, operators and size for both classes

            *Note    
                bottom() for Stack is similar to End() for Queue its just since
                we used top() for the first node opposite of top was bottom

            **Note   
                both end and bottom functions return nullptr but when testing 
                pop() I had them return the last to check if _end_ptr would be
                set to null after removing entire item from list

        -Partly implemented:
            None

        -Not Implemented: 
                    None

    Bugs:
        -None

    Reflections:
        - This was an easy project. The hardest part was writing the
          list functions but after that stack and queue was just making
          a few changes to the List class
