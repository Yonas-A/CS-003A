    Features:
        -Not Implemented: None
        -Implemented: 1D functions, 2D functions, Lab functions and Plane functions
        -Partly implemented:none

    Bugs:
        -None

    Reflections:
        -Both lab and plane function work without any problem. However I am not sure
            if deallocate function for the 2D array works  properly. When I tried to
            print the 2D array after deallocate 2D function, apart from a couple of
            rows, the rest appears as it was before deallocate function was called.

    Note:
        -I have a printPlane 1d and 2D function to print the plane seats and convert them from boolean
         value to  letters
        -I wasn't sure how to add an existing file so I just created a new one_d and two_d header file
          in this project.
        -For the lab, only a three digit or more is accepted for ID
