            all of poly class functions and Term struct functions

        -Partly implemented:

        -Not Implemented: 
            None

    Bugs:
        -None

    Reflections:
        -Had trouble every now and then on some operations like division
         were a little complicated, I had to look up a couple of videos
         but once i got past it I found it to be an aha
         moment. Extraction Operator tho was really getting on my nerve
         before somebody pointed to me I had to write the term extraction
         operator
         input extraction works if the end is marked with 0x^0 only.
